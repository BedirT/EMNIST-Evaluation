# EMNIST-Evaluation
Mini-Project for CMPUT 566 - University of Alberta taught by Martha White.

The goal is to learn how to compare and evaluate different algorithms. The task is to choose 3 different algorithms, evaluate, and prepare a report. 

We worked on EMNIST data set and compared three classification algorithms.
